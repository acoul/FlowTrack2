FlowTrack2
==========

This is my rewrite of [FlowTrack](https://github.com/skarfacegc/FlowTrack) in node and elastic search.

Why?

- Want to learn something new
- The time bucketing code was annoying to write, elastic search seems to do it automatically.
- scale.  This will be able to handle more than sqlite.
